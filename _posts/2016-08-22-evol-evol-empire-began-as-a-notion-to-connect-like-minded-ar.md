  EVOL EVOL EMPIRE began as a notion to connect like minded artists of all
  forms. It has since evolved into a global art collective that strives to
  spread light and the growth of self expression through its multifaceted
  talent. With a general focus on music, art and photography, the art collective
  is and embodyment of an evolving movement. With a name conceptualized from the
  theory of duality we as a collective understand that your perspective impacts
  the world around you. Each artist is set on growing their talents in their
  respective fields by representing the true meaning of individuality and global
  progression. This positive growth movement has a contagious and cohesive
  effect on all who are exposed to it, for once the mind has been presented with
  a new idea, it can never go back to its original dimensions. -anson attis
